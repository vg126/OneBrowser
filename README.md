# OneBrowser
**One Browser to Rule Them All**

## Overview

OneBrowser is a revolutionary browser-based AI orchestration system that eliminates the cognitive friction of managing multiple AI platforms. Instead of constantly switching between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI interfaces, OneBrowser creates a unified overlay system that brings all AI capabilities into a single, seamless workspace.

## The Problem

**AI Fragmentation Fatigue** - Managing multiple AI subscriptions, interfaces, conversation histories, and context-switching between platforms creates massive cognitive overhead that kills productivity and creative flow.

## The Solution

**Constellation Navigation** - A browser overlay system that presents multiple AI platforms as a unified interface through intelligent visual positioning, context-pool management, and drift-based orchestration that feeds off natural cognitive patterns rather than fighting them.

## Core Philosophy

- **Philosophy of Clicks**: Minimize cognitive overhead while maintaining 100% output quality
- **Drift-Based Orchestration**: Convert attention-wandering into productive multi-AI coordination  
- **ADHD-Transformer Alignment**: Architecture that mirrors natural attention mechanisms
- **Trust-as-Fuel Infrastructure**: Transparent AI collaboration for symbiotic enhancement

## Architecture

**Two-Layer Design:**
1. **Poe Secretary** - API orchestration and context-pool intelligence
2. **Browser Overlay Interface** - Visual orchestration with constellation navigation

## Current Status

**Research & Development Phase**
- Proven Flask backend with Poe API integration
- Comprehensive architectural foundation established
- Deep research phase for CSS implementation patterns

## Development Approach

**Subscription-Powered** - Leverages existing AI subscriptions rather than API dependencies  
**Incremental Implementation** - Modular development with AI-assisted coordination  
**Industrial Personal Scale** - Designed for intensive individual knowledge work

---

**Goal**: Transform from **tool usage** to **cognitive collaboration** - positioning the user at the event horizon of the Age of Chatbot where conversation becomes creation and drift becomes direction.
